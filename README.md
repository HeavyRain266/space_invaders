# Space Invaders clone

Simple game made with [bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy), implemented it after following this [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yb3vInxzKGE) (my implementaion isn't complete yet).

### How to build & run:
At first, clone source code.
```
git clone https://github.com/HeavyRain266/space_invaders.git
```

Now you can simply build and run game.

> Note: after building, move executable from release folder into project's root folder in order to load assets or simply run `cargo run --release` instead.

```
cd space_invaders

cargo build --release
```

### Controls:

**Keys**:
  - **WASD**: Movement
  - **Space**: Shooting
  - **F & Espace**: Turn on/off fullscreen mode
  - **Delete**: Exit game
